## How to use this guide
- We suggest that you start by creating all of the necessary accounts so you are always in-the-loop with the rest of the group.
- If you aren't familiar with `bash`, `git`, `Python`, and `C++`, we strongly suggest you search the internet and complete tutorials in each. 
- For general software best practices the [MolSSI Education website](http://education.molssi.org/resources.html) is a great resource.

# Accounts
## Accounts (*Mandatory*)
* [CU Research Computing](https://rc.colorado.edu/support/getting-started.html): If you are a graduate student, please contact Sandeep and have him contact research computing. We suggest using the DuoMobile app for the two part authentication (rather than the fob).
* [Asana](https://app.asana.com/): We use this to track projects in tasks in the group.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/): Make sure you use your colorado.edu email.

## Other Suggested Accounts
* [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/): Used to track your publications.
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/)

# Installing and Running Software
- Check out the guide `./installing_software/general_sofware.md` about how to install (almost) all of the software you'll need for the group.
- To start putting all that new software to use check out the tutorials in `./tutorials`.

# Funding
- If you're interested in getting some of your own funding, check out the resources in `./funding`. There are a lot of options for US and non-US citizens. If you're interested, talk to older graduate students in the group and _apply early_!
