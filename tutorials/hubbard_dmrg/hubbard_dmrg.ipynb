    "## DMRG using MPS: Hubbard model\n",
    "\n",
    "This program does a DMRG calculation of the ground state of the fermionic Hubbard model by variationally optimizing an MPS. The code for doing tensor operations and sweep iterations has been adapted from a tutorial by Ian McCulloch (https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/IanMcCulloch/mptoolkit/index.php?n=Tutorials.MPS-DMRG?from=APCTPWorkshop.MPS-DMRG) with minor changes and a few additional comments. It is not meant to be efficient, but it is very readable. Here, MPS and MPO are stored as lists of the size of the chain, with each member being a local tensor. "

    "As seen above, MPS formalism of DMRG is cast in terms of Fock spaces. One advantage of using Fock spaces is that it affords a product representation of composite spaces. For example, the Fock space at a single site $i$ of the Hubbard model is given by:  $\\mathcal{F}_i=\\text{Range}\\{\\mid0\\rangle_i, \\mid\\uparrow\\rangle_i, \\mid\\downarrow\\rangle_i, \\mid\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle_i\\}$. The Fock space of composition of two sites $i$ and $j$ is the product space of the two local Fock spaces on each site: $\\mathcal{F}_{ij}=\\mathcal{F}_i\\otimes\\mathcal{F}_j$. Note that this is different from a fixed particle number representation of fermionic spaces, where the composite space is an antisymmetrized product. In the Fock space formalism, the onus of antisymmetry is laid upon operators. This can be analyzed in a couple of different but equivalent ways. One of the ways is to look at the anticommutation relations between fermionic operators. Equivalently we can analyze the action of these operators on occupation number basis states.
